# Project: Sudoku Game

This project is my first independent project with [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend). With this project, I am aiming to implement a playable & solvable game of Sudoku from scratch. Specific goals are:

1. Implement game playable from command line
2. Implement game playable from GUI
3. Create a function that can solve a sudoku board
4. Create a function that can initialize a unique, solvable sudoku board
5. Implement UI that performs backtracking algorithm to solve a puzzle


## Testing

Run `python3 -m unittest discover` in the terminal to perform all unit tests
